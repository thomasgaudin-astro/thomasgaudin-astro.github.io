A talk given to the hybrid members of the VLTI and CHARA users community about my Master's thesis work surrounding symbiotic stars.

Talk Abstract
=====


Symbiotic stars are a type of wide interacting binary system consisting of a cool giant star and a hot companion, typically a white dwarf. These systems are characterized by wide binary separation, a long orbital period, and a dense circumstellar medium produced by mass transfer from giant to companion. The rates and mechanisms that govern the mass transfer process within symbiotic stars are currently poorly understood. Improving our understanding of mass transfer in these systems is important in connecting them to important stellar objects such as planetary nebulae and Type Ia supernovae and in determining the role that symbiotic stars play in the late stages of stellar evolution. Research suggests that the ideal method of investigating mass transfer in symbiotic stars is to directly image the cool giant in these systems with an optical interferometer. This work presents the initial results of an optical interferometry study to use the Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy (CHARA) Array for the purpose of imaging symbiotic stars. The techniques of model fitting and direct imaging of the cool giant in four symbiotic star systems were used in an effort to search for the presence of radial asymmetry such as a Roche lobe. Once the radial diameter of each system was known, the Roche filling factor was able to be determined, giving valuable information about the mass-loss mechanism at work in each system.
