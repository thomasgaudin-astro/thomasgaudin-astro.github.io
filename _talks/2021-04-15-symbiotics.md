Poster detailing preliminary work towards my eventual Master's thesis project involving symbiotic stars. This presentation primarily presents the background research and plan for future work.

Talk Abstract
=====

Symbiotic star systems are a type of interacting stellar binary in which a red giant star is closely orbited by a white dwarf (WD) or other compact object. These systems are characterized by a long orbital period, wide binary separation, and a dense circumstellar medium produced by mass transfer from giant to WD. The nature and mechanisms of mass transfer within symbiotic systems are currently poorly understood. Research suggests that the best way to test mass transfer models is to measure the Roche Lobe radius of the giant star using an optical interferometer. However, few studies have attempted these measurements and none have used CHARA. The high resolution of CHARA presents an opportunity to measure the geometry of symbiotic giants in unprecedented detail.Â In preparation for the observation of several symbiotic systems using the CHARA Optical Interferometer, we present the scientific case for our observations and the pre-observation modeling performed. Detailed imaging of the giant will be used to determine the Roche-filling factor of the giants and better constrain mass transfer present in the system.
