A talk about my Master's thesis work surrounding symbiotic stars that was presented to the Penn State Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics as part of their Tuesday Lunch Talks series.

Talk Abstract
=====

Symbiotic stars are a type of wide interacting binary system consisting of a cool giant star and a hot companion, typically a white dwarf. These systems are characterized by wide binary separation, a long orbital period, and a dense circumstellar medium produced by mass transfer from giant to companion. The mechanism that governs the mass transfer process within symbiotic stars is currently poorly understood. Improving our understanding of mass transfer in these systems is important in connecting them to important stellar objects such as planetary nebulae and Type Ia supernovae and in determining the role that symbiotic stars play in the late stages of binary stellar evolution. Research suggests that the ideal method of investigating mass transfer in symbiotic stars is to directly image the cool giant in these systems with an optical interferometer. This talk presents the initial results of an optical interferometry study to use the Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy (CHARA) Array for the purpose of imaging the red giant in nearby symbiotic star systems. The techniques of model fitting and direct imaging were used in an effort to search for the presence of radial asymmetric behavior and evidence in favor for or against Roche lobe overflow. Images presented in this talk represent the highest-resolution observations ever attempted for a symbiotic star system and provide the strongest evidence to date against Roche lobe overflow as the dominant mass transfer mechanism in these systems.
