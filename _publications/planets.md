This work is a case study for a science education textbook that I wrote during my time as an educator working in the Sudekum Planetarium. The goal of this piece is to provide a thought-provoking educational scenario (in this case a planetarium field trip gone wrong) that can help future teachers to be better prepared for the challenges that they may face in the classroom as science educators.
