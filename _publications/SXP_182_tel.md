This paper is a telegram announcing the discovery of a new Be/X-ray binary, SXP 182, by the NASA Swift mission during a Type I outburst. 
This source was first identified by my first Swift research project that pioneered new methods of Be/X-ray Binary detection using archival Swift and VizieR data.
