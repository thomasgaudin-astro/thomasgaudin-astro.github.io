Hello!
======
Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Thomas Gaudin. I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Pennsylvania State University studying Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am an observational astronomer who is broadly interested in the late stages of stellar evolution. My specific focus for the last few years has been the study of symbiotic stars. On this site, you can find information about my stellar evolution research, my teaching experiences, and my various personal hobbies. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out via email at either tmg6006@psu.edu or thomas.gaudin73@gmail.com

About Me
======
I was born and raised among the rolling hills of Chattanooga, Tennessee. My college experience took me away from Tennessee to Greenville, South Carolina where earned my B.S. in Physics with a minor in Informal Science Education at Furman University. Furman was the first place to expose me to astronomy, and it did so primarily through educational opportunities. As a college student, I became an experienced science educator, working at both the Creative Discovery Museum in Chattanooga and at Roper Mountain Science Center. By the time I graduated, I had worked at observatories, planetariums, and maker spaces educating guests of all ages about science. 

After college, I decided to leave academia to work in education. I was hired for two years as a planetarium educator at Adventure Science Center in Nashville, TN.
