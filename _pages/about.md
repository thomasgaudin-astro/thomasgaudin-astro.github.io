## Hello!

Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Thomas Gaudin. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Pennsylvania State University studying Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am an observational astronomer who is broadly interested in the late stages of binary stellar evolution. As a Master's student, I focused on the study of symbiotic stars. Now, as a Ph.D. student, I work with the Niels Gehrels Swift Observatory's Science Operations Team to improve our understanding of Be/X-ray Binaries. On this site, you can find information about my stellar evolution research, my teaching experiences, and my various personal hobbies. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out via email at either [tmg6006@psu.edu](tmg6006@psu.edu) or [thomasgaudin.astro@gmail.com](thomasgaudin.astro@gmail.com).

### About Me

I was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee. My undergraduate studies took place in Greenvilke, South Carolina, where I earned my B.S. in Physics with a minor in Informal Science Education at Furman University. Furman was the first place to expose me to astronomy, and it did so primarily through educational opportunities. As a college student, I became an experienced science educator, working at both the Creative Discovery Museum in Chattanooga and at the Roper Mountain Science Center in Greenville. By the time I graduated, I had worked at observatories, planetariums, and maker spaces educating guests of all ages about science, particularly astronomy. 

After college, I was hired as a planetarium educator for the Sudekum Planetarium at Adventure Science Center in Nashville, TN. Here, I honed my public speaking and science outreach abilities, both through my work with the museum and through my volunteer efforts with the Barnard-Seyfert Astronomical Society. 

In 2020, I applied and was accepted to New Mexico Tech, where I completed my Master's Degree in Physics. At NMT, I began astronomical research as I studied under Dr. Ryan Norris, using optical interferometry to observe nearby symbiotic stars. My research career continues now at Penn State, where I work under Dr. Jamie Kennea to use the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED) as a tool for detecting and studying the large population of Be/X-ray Binaries that exist within the galaxy. 

In my free time, I am a big sports fan and an avid hiker. I can usually be found either at a Penn State sporting event or on one of the many excellent trails that surround State College in Central Pennsylvania.
