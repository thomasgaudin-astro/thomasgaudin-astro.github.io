It's Called Soccer: The Weekly US Soccer Podcast
-----

<img align="left" src="/images/My_project_copy_2_2.png" alt="ICS Logo" width="250"/>
I have long been a soccer fan. I started following the US Men's and Women's National Teams at the 2010 World Cup. In 2020, being a fan turned into amateur journalism with the birth of the It's Called Soccer podcast. We post weekly episodes that cover everything from National Team matches to the MLS and Americans playing for club soccer teams in Europe. It's Called Soccer has led to great friendships and cool experiences such as press access to the 2023 United Soccer Coaches Convention, where our podcast headlined Podcast Row.

You can find more information about the podcast on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ItsCalledSoccer) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ItsCalledSocPod). Episodes can also be streamed on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0JMA10DbC6YoaTyT0mXZai?si=59144efa4fc4491b) or [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-called-soccer-the-weekly-us-soccer-show/id1571302680).

Astrophotography and Hiking
-----

When I can, I am an avid hiker. I particularly enjoy exploring the American Southwest and the Appalachain Mountains. While out in remote areas, I enjoy  using my DSLR to take amateur nature photography of the landscapes that I find. Additionally, I have worked both by myself and with various amateur astronomical societies to improve my DSLR astrophotography. I typically shoot with a Nikon D3400 using a 18mm f/3.5 or a 300mm f/6.3 lens. My shots are tracked by a Star Adventurer and processed using Adobe Photography Suite or PixInsight. Some of my photos are shown below.
