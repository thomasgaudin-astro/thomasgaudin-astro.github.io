It's Called Soccer: The Weekly US Soccer Podcast
-----

<img align="left" src="/images/stacked_SU_Lyn_p_10chain.png" alt="ICS Logo" width="250"/>
I have long been a soccer fan. I started following the US Men's and Women's National Teams at the 2010 World Cup. In 2020, being a fan turned into amateur journalism with the birth of the It's Called Soccer podcast. We post weekly episodes that cover everything from National Team matches to the MLS and Americans playing for club soccer teams in Europe. It's Called Soccer has led to great friendships and cool experiences such as press access to the 2023 United Soccer Coaches Convention, where our podcast headlined Podcast Row.

You can find more information about the podcast on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ItsCalledSoccer) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ItsCalledSocPod). Episodes can also be streamed on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0JMA10DbC6YoaTyT0mXZai?si=59144efa4fc4491b) or [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-called-soccer-the-weekly-us-soccer-show/id1571302680).
