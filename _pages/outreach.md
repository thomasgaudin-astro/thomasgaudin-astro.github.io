SC 451: Outreach Design and Facilitation
-----

As part of the curriculum for SC 451, a seminar taken at Pennsylvania State University, I gained experience with planning and implementing my own outreach event.
This event was planned in collaboration with graduate students from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
Our combined experience allowed us to create an event called "Life in the Universe" that would cater to a middle school audience.
Life in the Universe was designed to have several activities that would demonstrate how astronomers and biochemists contribute to our understanding of life beyond Earth.
My activity was the first activity that students engaged with during the event.
I created a planetarium show called "Solar System Safari" that showcased the various planets and moons beyond Earth that have the best chance of hosting life.
Solar System Safari took advantage of the Emerald planetarium projector at Penn State, using it to perform virtual flights through the solar system and explore worlds such as Mars and Europa. 
Flights such as these gave students a chance to learn about our history of solar system exploration and how it has advanced the search for life beyond Earth.

Astronomy on Tap: State College Chapter
-----

<img align="left" src="/images/AOT Logo.png" alt="AOTSC Logo" width="250"/>
I have been involved as an organizer of State College's chapter of Astronomy on Tap since arriving at Penn State. Astronomy on Tap is a worldwide outreach organization with chapters in most major cities. Each chapter puts on a monthly event that brings astronomical research to the general public through public outreach talks in a local bar. In State College, our monthly events are held at Happy Valley Brewing Company and feature two public talks given by astronomers about their science or some fun topic in astronomy. Additionally, each event features an Astro in the News and an Astronomy Trivia segment. As part of the team, I help to coordinate which speakers will be selected for a given month, help to plan each event, and serve as the trivia master, writing all of the trivia questions for each month's event.

University Outreach
-----

**Penn State**

As a member of the Penn State Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, I have helped with several outreach events. During our yearly AstroFest event, I help to coordinate rooftop observing, and I also give planetarium shows in the Davey Planetarium. I have also helped with school field trips by running planetarium shows for groups that visit the department. Additionally, I enjoy participating in rooftop open house events where we invite public audiences to join us for telescope observing on the roof of our building one night a month. 

Davey Laboratory recently underwent a major renovation to overhaul our planetarium, and I contributed heavily to this upgrade. As a member of the team overseeing this upgrade, I sat in on discussions of vendor pitches, contributed to the design of the new planetarium, and drove content creation for shows on the newly-digitized system. 

**New Mexico Tech**

During my second year as a Master's student at New Mexico Tech, I was hired as a Teaching Assistant by the Department of Outreach for the university. This role came with a few major responsibilities. The first was to be a liason between the department and any professors who neeeded help with their outreach events. This could include anything from helping these professors plan their outreach for broader impact statements to being an extra helping hand at an outreach event. I helped with everything from Battle Bots to Antarctica research. The second thing major responsibility was to be an event organizer for the major outrezch events that the Department of Outreach put on every year. New Mexico Tech is the host of the state Science Fair and the state championships of Science Olympiad. As a member of the outreach department, I server as a judge for the Science Fair and as a test writer and event host for Science Olympiad. I also helped to organize the awards show for each event and helped to coordinate volunteers throughout.

My major contribution to the NMT Department of Outreach was to serve on the symposium organizing committee for the Navajo Nation Water Purification Project (N4WPP) Water Symposium. N4WPP works with the Navajo Nation in partnership with other eduational institutions and community leaders to help deal with the clean water shortage crisis in the Navajo Nation lands in Northwest New Mexico. The Water Symposium was a two-day symposium at Farmington High School that aimed to educate high school studnets about the importance of clean water. There were vaious events including a clean water engineering design challenge as well. As a member of the organizing committee, I sat in on all planning meetings, contributed to the advertising efforts, and was able to be on site for the whole symposium to do whatever was needed to make sure that the event ran smoothly.


Museum Education Experience
-----

**Adventure Science Center**

After my undergraduate studies, I spent 2 years working at Adventure Science Center as a Planetarium Educator. My role was primarily to present shows in the Sudekum Planetarium, both live and recorded. I was able to write and present my own version of "Nightwatch", a live star talk that would change with the seasons. The other live show that I performed was a show called "Destination Solar System", a show with a script that requires some acting on the part of the presenter as they fly through the solar system. I was also responsible for presenting recorded shows and laser shows. I contributed to planning and execution of special events such as Drink and Discover nights. I also served as a member of the Outreach Team, driving to local schools to work on outreach events when I was not scheduled to be in the planetarium.

When I was not presenting shows, I was working on creating educator guides for all of our shows. Educator guides are essentially lesson plan and field trip prep aides for teachers that were considering bringing a school group to a planetarium show. Each educator guide contained a brief summary of the show, a list of vocabulary words that the show mentions, suggestions for pre-visit and post-visit activities, and a summary of all Tennessee and Next Generation Science Standards that are relevant to the show. These educator guides were published on the website for the museum and were distrbuted to all of our teachers during Teacher Open House events.

**Roper Mountain Science Center**

I served as a Science Education and Astronomy Intern for my last summer of college at Roper Mountain Science Center. Roper Mountain Science Center is a center for science education that is run by the Greenville County School District. During the school year, the center is primarily responsible for teaching field trip classes to schools within the county school system. During the summer, Roper Mountain becomes a space for hosting week-long summer camps that are either taught by the center's instructors or by local educators. As a Science Education Intern, my role was primarily to be an aide for whichever summer camp needed me on a given day or in a given week. Sometimes, I would be assigned to work with an instructor for a full week. Other times, I would spend only a single day helping with an event or would supervise a field trip. I helped with 15 total camps over the course of 8 weeks, instructing students on everything from 3-D printing and movie making to astronomy and engineering. 

Roper Mountain is also home to a large observatory and planetarium. Every Friday night they host a Starry Nights event where the general public can come to see a planetarium show or look through the 24" Clark refractor telescope. I spent my Friday nights volunteering for this event and etiher helping in the planetarium or helping to facilitate telescope observing at the observatory. Sometimes I would help to operate the large 24" telescope. Sometimes, I would be responsible for a smaller telescope outside of the observatory. I was also on hand for the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse, which passed right over Roper Mountain. As part of this event, I spent 3 days outside of the observatory facilitating solar observing and talking to crowds about the solar eclipse.
