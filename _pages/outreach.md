SC 451: Outreach Design and Facilitation
-----

As part of the curriculum for SC 451, a seminar taken at Pennsylvania State University, I gained experience with planning and implementing my own outreach event.
This event was planned in collaboration with graduate students from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
Our combined experience allowed us to create an event called "Life in the Universe" that would cater to a middle school audience.
Life in the Universe was designed to have several activities that would demonstrate how astronomers and biochemists contribute to our understanding of life beyond Earth.
My activity was the first activity that students engaged with during the event.
I created a planetarium show called "Solar System Safari" that showcased the various planets and moons beyond Earth that have the best chance of hosting life.
Solar System Safari took advantage of the Emerald planetarium projector at Penn State, using it to perform virtual flights through the solar system and explore worlds such as Mars and Europa. 
Flights such as these gave students a chance to learn about our history of solar system exploration and how it has advanced the search for life beyond Earth.

Astronomy on Tap: State College Chapter
-----

I have been involved as an organizer of State College's chapter of Astronomy on Tap since arriving at Penn State. Astronomy on Tap is a worldwide outreach organization with chapters in most major cities. Each chapter puts on a monthly event that brings astronomical research to the general public through public outreach talks in a local bar. In State College, our monthly events are held at Happy Valley Brewing Co.
