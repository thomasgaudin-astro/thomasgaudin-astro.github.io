SC 451: Outreach Design and Facilitation
-----

As part of the curriculum for SC 451, a seminar taken at Pennsylvania State University, I gained experience with planning and implementing my own outreach event.
This event was planned in collaboration with graduate students from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
Our combined experience allowed us to create an event called "Life in the Universe" that would cater to a middle school audience.
Life in the Universe was designed to have several activities that would demonstrate how astronomers and biochemists contribute to our understanding of life beyond Earth.
My activity was the first activity that students engaged with during the event.
I created a planetarium show called "Solar System Safari" that showcased the various planets and moons beyond Earth that have the best chance of hosting life.
Solar System Safari took advantage of the Emerald planetarium projector at Penn State, using it to perform virtual flights through the solar system and explore worlds such as Mars and Europa. 
Flights such as these gave students a chance to learn about our history of solar system exploration and how it has advanced the search for life beyond Earth.

Astronomy on Tap: State College Chapter
-----

I have been involved as an organizer of State College's chapter of Astronomy on Tap since arriving at Penn State. Astronomy on Tap is a worldwide outreach organization with chapters in most major cities. Each chapter puts on a monthly event that brings astronomical research to the general public through public outreach talks in a local bar. In State College, our monthly events are held at Happy Valley Brewing Company and feature two public talks given by astronomers about their science or some fun topic in astronomy. Additionally, each event features an Astro in the News and an Astronomy Trivia segment. As part of the team, I help to coordinate which speakers will be selected for a given month, help to plan each event, and serve as the trivia master, writing all of the trivia questions for each month's event.

University Outreach

**Penn State**

As a member of the Penn State Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, I have helped with several outreach events. During our yearly AstroFest event, I help to coordinate rooftop observing, and I also give planetarium shows in the Davey Planetarium. I have also helped with school field trips by running planetarium shows for groups that visit the department. Additionally, I enjoy participating in rooftop open house events where we invite public audiences to join us for telescope observing on the roof of our building one night a month. 

Davey Laboratory recently underwent a major renovation to overhaul our planetarium, and I contributed heavily to this upgrade. As a member of the team overseeing this upgrade, I sat in on discussions of vendor pitches, contributed to the design of the new planetarium, and drove content creation for shows on the newly-digitized system. 

**New Mexico Tech**

During my second year as a Master's student at New Mexico Tech, I was hired as a Teaching Assistant by the Department of Outreach for the university. This role came with two major responsibilities.
