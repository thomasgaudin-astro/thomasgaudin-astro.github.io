SC 451: Outreach Design and Facilitation
-----

As part of the curriculum for SC 451, a seminar taken at Pennsylvania State University, I gained experience with planning and implementing my own outreach event.
This event was planned in collaboration with graduate students from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
Our combined experience allowed us to create an event called "Life in the Universe" that would cater to a middle school audience.
Life in the Universe was designed to have several activities that would demonstrate how astronomers and biochemists contribute to our understanding of life beyond Earth.
My activity was the first activity that students engaged with during the event.
I created a planetarium show called "Solar System Safari" that showcased the various planets and moons beyond Earth that have the best chance of hosting life.
Solar System Safari took advantage of the Emerald planetarium projector at Penn State, using it to perform virtual flights through the solar system and explore worlds such as Mars and Europa. 
Flights such as these gave students a chance to learn about our history of solar system exploration and how it has advanced the search for life beyond Earth.

Astronomy on Tap: State College Chapter

When I can, I am an avid hiker. I particularly enjoy exploring the American Southwest and the Appalachain Mountains. While out in remote areas, I enjoy  using my DSLR to take amateur nature photography of the landscapes that I find. Additionally, I have worked both by myself and with various amateur astronomical societies to improve my DSLR astrophotography. I typically shoot with a Nikon D3400 using a 18mm f/3.5 or a 300mm f/6.3 lens. My shots are tracked by a Star Adventurer and processed using Adobe Photography Suite or PixInsight. Some of my photos are shown below.
