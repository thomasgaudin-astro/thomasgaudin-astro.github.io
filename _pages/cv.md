     * Made observations of several symbiotic star systems to investigate the mass transfer mechanism and rate that govern these interacting binary stars.
     * Used the CHARA Array to search for radial asymmetry in the red giant of each system. Both visibility amplitude and imaging data was analyzed for each target.
     * Used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility to provide near-IR spectroscopy data that was used to characterize stellar parameters and calibrate the dust contributions to interferometry data in each system.
