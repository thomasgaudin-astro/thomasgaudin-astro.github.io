Education
-----

* B.S. in Physics, Furman University, 2018
  * Minor in Informal Science Education
* M.S. in Physics, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 2022
* M.S. in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pennsylvania State University, 2024
* Ph.D in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pennsylvania State University, 2028 (expected)

Research experience
-----

* Master's Thesis Project: An Investigation of Mass Transfer in Symbiotic Stars
  * New Mexico Insitute of Mining and Technology
  * Advisor: Dr. Ryan Norris
     * Made observations of several symbiotic star systems to investigate the mass transfer mechanism and rate that govern these interacting binary stars.
     * Used the CHARA Array to search for radial asymmetry in the red giant of each system. Both visibility amplitude and imaging data was analyzed for each target.
     * Used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility to provide near-IR spectroscopy data that was used to characterize stellar parameters and calibrate the dust contributions to interferometry data in each system.


* Semester Research Project: Solar Instrumentation Upgrade to Etscorn Campus Observatory (ECO)
  * New Mexico Insitute of Mining and Technology
  * Advisor: Dr. Ken Minschwanner
    * Participated in the background research and initial parameterization of a Lyot filter and heliostat that are planned to be installed at ECO for solar astronomy research.

* Semester Research Project: Relationship between Attitude Towards Physics and Scientific Misconceptions
  * Furman University
  * Advisor: Dr. Michael Svec
    * Used the Colorado Learning Attitutes about Science Survey (CLASS) and the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to investigate correlation between a studentâ€™s attitude towards physics and their conceptual understanding of Physics 1 subject matter.
