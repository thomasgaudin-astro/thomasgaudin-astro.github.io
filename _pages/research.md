The S-CUBED Survey: Be X-ray Binaries in the SMC
-----

My current research involves the S-CUBED survey that is being conducted by Dr. Jamie Kennea and the NASA Swift Science Operations Team. The S-CUBED survey is an effort to understand the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) population of the SMC. As the SMC has recently undergone a great increase in star formation due to what are thought to be interactions with the LMC, this dwarf galaxy has an unusually high population of HMXBs. The large majority of these systems are Be X-ray binaries (BeXBs). BeXBs contain an early-type OB star that show emission lines in their spectra due to an extretion disk that surrounds the star. Their companion is often a neutron star in an eccentric orbit that emits X-rays when it interacts with the OB star. This project surveys the SMC once per week to search for transient/persistent X-ray sources that may be candidate X-ray binaries. 


Symbiotic Star Mass Transfer

My primary area of research for the past two years has been my Master's thesis work on symbiotic stars. Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries containing a red giant with a white dwarf companion. I am interested in the evolution of these rare systems into more evolved binaries such as cataclysmic variable stars, then into the eventual transient phenomena that will be produced. In order to figure out how symbiotic stars evolve, we must learn more about how the red giant loses mass to the white dwarr. Specifically, we are looking to answer the question: "What mechanism drives mass transfer in symbiotic stars?"


<img align="right" src="/images/aerial_Simison.jpg" alt="CHARA" width="400"/> To investigate this, we use optical interferometry. We use the CHARA (Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy) Array, a six telescope optical interferometer, to resolve the red giant in symbiotic stars. CHARA is effectively a 330 meter telescope and can not only see the surface of the red giant, but also features on the surface. We use the MIRC-X and MYSTIC beam combiners to fit geometric models to observed data and also to reconstruct images of our target stars. These methods allow us to search for the presence of a Roche lobe geometric asymmetry on each giant's surface. The presence or lack of a Roche lobe helps us to constrain the mass transfer mechanism. We can also start to constrain the role that stellar winds play in mass transfer.
