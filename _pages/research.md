Symbiotic Star Mass Transfer
=====

My primary area of research for the past two years has been my Master's thesis work on symbiotic stars. Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries containing a red giant with a white dwarf companion. I am interested in the evolution of these rare systems into more evolved binaries such as cataclysmic variable stars, then into the eventual transient phenomena that will be produced. In order to figure out how symbiotic stars evolve, we must learn more about how the red giant loses mass to the white dwarf. 

To investigate this, we use optical interferometry. We use the CHARA (Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy) Array, a six telescope optical interferometer, to resolve the red giant in symbiotic stars.

CHARA is effectively a 330 meter telescope and can not only see the surface of the red giant, but also features on the surface. We use the MIRC-X and MYSTIC beam combiners to both fit geometric models to observed data and also to reconstruct images of our target stars.
