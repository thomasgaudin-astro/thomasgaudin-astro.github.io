Symbiotic Star Mass Transfer

My primary area of research for the past two years has been my Master's thesis work on symbiotic stars. Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries containing a red giant with a white dwarf companion. I am interested in the evolution of these rare systems into more evolved binaries such as cataclysmic variable stars, then into the eventual transient phenomena that will be produced. In order to figure out how symbiotic stars evolve, we must learn more about how the red giant loses mass to the white dwarr. Specifically, we are looking to answer the question: "What mechanism drives mass transfer in symbiotic stars?"


To investigate this, we use optical interferometry. We use the CHARA (Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy) Array, a six telescope optical interferometer, to resolve the red giant in symbiotic stars. <img align="left" src="/images/aerial_Simison.jpg" alt="CHARA" width="250"/> CHARA is effectively a 330 meter telescope and can not only see the surface of the red giant, but also features on the surface. We use the MIRC-X and MYSTIC beam combiners to fit geometric models to observed data and also to reconstruct images of our target stars. These methods allow us to search for the presence of a Roche lobe geometric asymmetry on each giant's surface. The presence or lack of a Roche lobe helps us to constrain the mass transfer mechanism. We can also start to constrain the role that stellar winds play in mass transfer.
