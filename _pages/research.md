The Swift SMC Survey: Be/X-ray Binaries in the Small Magellanic Cloud
-----

## About S-CUBED

The Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED) is an effort to understand the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) population of the Small Magellanic Cloud, one of the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxies. As the SMC has recently undergone a great increase in star formation due to what are thought to be interactions with the LMC, this dwarf galaxy has an unusually high population of HMXBs, almost all of which are Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs). BeXRBs contain a massive main sequnce star that show emission lines in their spectra due to a large circumstellar disk that surrounds the star. Their companion is often a neutron star that emits X-rays when it interacts with the companion's disk. S-CUBED observes the SMC weekly to try and detect new sources as they produce X-ray outbursts. It also monitors known sources to watch for new outbursts. Using this survey, new BeXRBs have been discovered and many outbursts have been studied. This is the most complete survey to date of the X-ray properties of all sources known to exist within the SMC, BeXRB or other object.

## Detecting New BeXRBs

My current project focuses on identifying new detection methods for BeXRBs in the SMC using selected S-CUBED data and archival public data sets at lower-energy wavelengths. BeXRBs are known to go into long periods of X-ray quiescence where they cannot be detected by telescopes such as the Swift X-ray Telescope. Using a combination of X-ray selection methods, archival optical/infrared VizieR photometry, and Swift UV light curve data, I have been able to make predictions about which un-identified sources in the S-CUBED database are most likely to be quiescent BeXRBs. So far, I have identified six candidate sources and a paper is forthcoming about this new detection method. 


Symbiotic Star Mass Transfer

My Master's thesis topic while at New Mexico Tech was a project advised by Dr. Ryan Norris where we used optical interferometry to study symbiotic stars. Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries containing a red giant with a white dwarf companion. My thesis work primarily attempted to address the evolution of these rare systems into more evolved binaries such as cataclysmic variable stars, then into the eventual transient phenomena that will be produced. In order to figure out how symbiotic stars evolve, we must learn more about how the red giant loses mass to the white dwarr. Specifically, we are looking to answer the question: "What mechanism drives mass transfer in symbiotic stars?"
  
To investigate this, we use optical interferometry. We use the CHARA (Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy) Array, a six telescope optical interferometer, to resolve the red giant in symbiotic stars. CHARA is effectively a 330 meter telescope and can not only see the surface of the red giant, but also features on the surface. We use the MIRC-X and MYSTIC beam combiners to fit geometric models to observed data and also to reconstruct images of our target stars. These methods allow us to search for the presence of a Roche lobe geometric asymmetry on each giant's surface. The presence or lack of a Roche lobe helps us to constrain the mass transfer mechanism. We can also start to constrain the role that stellar winds play in mass transfer.
