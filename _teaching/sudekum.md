My first job out of college led me to Nashville, TN, where I was hired by the Adventure Science Center as a Planetarium Educator from August of 2018 to May of 2020. My role was to present live planetarium shows in the historic Sudekum Planetarium, a 60 foot hybrid dome with 4k projection capability and a Chiron optical star projector. In the course of my career there, I presented many shows and special events. Live shows ranged from full star talks to introduing movies or presenting a show involving a scripted acting role. I was also awarded the Most Outstanding Employee award for December of 2019.

As an educator, my role was predominantly to assist in the educational mission of the museum by presenting live astronomically-themed shows, developing content for field trips and other museum events
