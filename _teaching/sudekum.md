My first job out of college led me to Nashville, TN, where I was hired by the Adventure Science Center as a Planetarium Educator from August of 2018 to May of 2020. My role was to present live planetarium shows in the historic Sudekum Planetarium, a 60 foot hybrid dome with 4k projection capability and a Chiron optical star projector. In the course of my career there, I presented many shows and special events. Live shows ranged from full star talks to introduing movies or presenting a show involving a scripted acting role. I was also awarded the Most Outstanding Employee award for December of 2019.

Educator Guides

My main duty beyond presenting shows in the dome was to assist the museum in creating resources for teachers that connected to the shows presented in the planetarium. This was accomplished through the creation of "Educator Guides" for every planetarium show that provided additional educational resources that connected to the theme of every show and aided a teacher in easily fitting the planetarium show that their class came to see into their curriculum. Each educator guide consisted of a synopsis of the show, suggested pre- and post-trip activities, important vocabulary words connected to the show, and a list of the state and national education standards that were connected to the content presented in the planetarium. Over the course of my 18 month tenure, I helped to create educator guides for more than 15 shows and wrote more than 150 pages of material. Some of these guides are linked below.
