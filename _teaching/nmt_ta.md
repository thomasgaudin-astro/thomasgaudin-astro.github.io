As a first year graduate student at New Mexico Tech, I was employed as a Teaching Assistant for introductory physics classes for the univeristy. 
Introductory physics labs are mandatory for all students who take the lecture course and are intedended to provide supplemental hands-on instruction for students to improve their understanding of course material. 
During the fall semester, I was the instructor of two of these supplemental introductory Physics I labs. 
During the spring semester, I was the instructor of one supplemental Physics II lab. 

As instructor, I was responsible for lecturing before each lab, supervising student activities during the lab, answering any questions that came up, and grading all student activities/lab reports. 
This lab experience gave me experience with writing small lectures, teaching classical mechanics material/introdutory physics coursework, and proving adequate feedback on assigned student work. 
These lab courses were valuable classroom experience that taught me a great deal about communicating introductory physics material at the university level in a manner that improved classroom performance.
