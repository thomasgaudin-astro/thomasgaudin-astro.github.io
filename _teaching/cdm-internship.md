Creative Discovery Museum gave me my first teaching experience as an intern in the Science Department. My main responsibilities were to work on the floor of the museum as a facilitator in the Make-It Space. In the Make-It Space, we taught plenty of new skills. Predominatly, my role was to teach students how to woodwork and hand-sew to create their own crafts. Additionally, we utilizd recylced materials to create 3-D sculptures, recycled electronics for take-apart projects, a wind-tunnel for parachute testing, and several types of technological eductational materials (e.g. Cubelets, Sphero, Makey-Makey). My main responsibility, however, was the design of the Circuit Block program.

Circuit Blocks
======

To teach simple circuits effectively, we tried to leverage the creativity of guests to build whatever circuits they could imagine. Circuit blocks are literal blocks of wood with electronic components nailed to them. Components could be batteries, switches, or resistors (powered components such as light bulbs or motors). Each block was able to be connected to others via homemade wires with alligator clips that could connect to each end. All components used to make the circuit blocks were salvaged from the various materials and recycled electronics found in the space. In addition to small blocks, larger creations were made such as lighthouses and fabric animals that could be powered by the blocks and would draw guests' eyes as they came through the space.
